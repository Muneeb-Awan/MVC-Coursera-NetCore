🚀 Project Completed: MyCoursera Clone (Learning Project) 🎓

I’m excited to share that I successfully completed my ASP.NET Core MVC learning project – a mini platform inspired by Coursera.

📚 Throughout this journey, I built a role-based e-learning system where:
✅ Students can explore, enroll, and manage courses
✅ Instructors can create courses, manage enrollments, and track progress
✅ Admins can approve/reject courses, manage users, and monitor the platform

🔑 Key Features I Implemented:
• Role-based authentication & authorization (Admin, Instructor, Student)
• Course enrollment & cancellation
• Instructor dashboards with stats & rankings
• Student dashboards with enrolled courses, progress tracking, and recommendations
• Admin panel with approval workflows & platform insights
• Professional & responsive UI using Bootstrap 5

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used:
• ASP.NET Core MVC 8
• Entity Framework Core (with SQL Server)
• Identity for Authentication & Authorization
• Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI
• LINQ & EF Core Queries
• Razor Pages & MVC Views

🌱 Learning Takeaways:
• Deeper understanding of ASP.NET Core MVC architecture
• Hands-on with Many-to-Many EF Core relationships & navigation properties
• Implementing role-based access control effectively
• Designing user-friendly dashboards & workflows
• Deployment considerations (Azure, Linux VM + NGROK testing)

✨ This project was a big step in improving my .NET full-stack development skills and gave me confidence to build more real-world applications.
